# Overview

The 5 day RISC-V Myth (microprocessor for you in thirty hours) workshop is conducted by [VLSI system design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/riscv-based-myth/?v=a98eef2a3105) and [Redwood EDA](https://www.redwoodeda.com/tl-verilog). This workshop starts from the beginner level of understanding the basic software to hardware integration done by writing a simple c program for driving the assembly language  program to finally built a RISC-V pipelinened architecture for the same. As VSD has an intelligent cloud based VSDA-IAT platform the entire workshop contents, assessments and initial labs are carried out in the platform itself. Thereafter the TL based Makerchip platform as given in the github repository https://github.com/stevehoover/RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop for implementation of RISC-V core is used. Prior to the implemantation of the core some simple digital logics along with a calculator was implemented in  Makerchip platform for better understanding of the platform and TL verilog.
